# E2E Tests + Visual Analysis Workflow
#
# This workflow has two jobs:
#
# 1. e2e-tests (BLOCKING) — Runs all 158 Playwright E2E tests.
#    If any test fails, the PR cannot be merged.
#    Runs on: every push to main AND every pull request.
#
# 2. visual-analysis (ADVISORY) — Takes screenshots of every page,
#    sends them to Gemini Vision AND GPT o4-mini Vision for dual AI layout
#    analysis, and posts the report as a PR comment. Never blocks merge.
#    Runs on: pull requests only, after e2e-tests passes.

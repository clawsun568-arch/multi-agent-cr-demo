# Contributing Workflow (Multi-Agent + Human Approval)

## Required flow
1. One coding agent implements changes on a feature branch.
2. A second agent reviews and leaves PR review feedback.
3. At least one human approval is required before merge.

## Branch/PR rules
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Use feature branches and PRs.
- CI must pass before merge.
